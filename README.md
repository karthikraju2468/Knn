This is a code repository along with notebooks and tutorials related to a machine learning assignment that aims at learning about the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification algorithm. It investigates the influence of hyperparameter k on model behaviour, decision boundaries, and classification performance with the use of Scikit-Learn Wine dataset.
**Project Overview**

This project aims to give a tutorial or educational explanation of the k-NN algorithm. The tutorial explains the significance of preprocessing methods like scaling of features, the bias- variance trade-off and the performance of the model under varied values of k.

The repository includes:
The fundamental implementation is written in a Python script (.py).
A tutorial document containing the theory and results (2000 words).

Plots and analyses of support.
README and a license to reproduce and understand.
Dataset
The dataset used in the project is the Wine dataset which has 178 samples of three wine cultivars. All the samples are characterised by 13 continuous chemical characteristics including alcohol content, phenols, flavanoids, and colour intensity.
The data is pedagogical due to its balance, all-numerical and scalable nature, which is also the appropriate type of data to apply the distance-based algorithms such as k-NN.
